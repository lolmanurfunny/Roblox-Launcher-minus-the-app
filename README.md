# Roblox-Launcher-minus-the-app

A custom-made Roblox Launcher. Why would I keep patching Roblox's abhorrent launcher, when I can build my own! 

_If your Roblox files are not installed to ``%localappdata%/Roblox/Versions`` then don't open a new issue. Instead, uninstall roblox, and reinstall it but this time, don't run it as administrator! You will not in anyway benefit the maintenance of this software if you make an issue regarding the launcher not being able to find your roblox files!_

# Automatic installer (recommended)

Requirements: none.

1. Make sure you run it as admin or it might not fully work
2. If this does not work delete the Roblox-Launcher filel from %localappdata%/Roblox/Versions then try again
3. This will be updated as soon as a new update comes out, as far as we know every Wednesday.
# Manual Instructions

1. Open File Explorer and go to your roblox directory ``%localappdata%/Roblox/Versions``

2. Look for the version folder that contains `RobloxPlayerLauncher.exe`

3. Delete your current `RobloxPlayerLauncher.exe` and replace it with the custom one;
   
**Inside the folder patcher, then src (sourcecode)**
